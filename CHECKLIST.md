# GroveIQ Build Checklist

Tracks progress against `SPEC.md`'s phasing (section 6). Update this
alongside real changes — it's a snapshot, not a source of truth; the code
and `SPEC.md` are authoritative when they disagree with this file.

Last updated: 2026-08-13.

## Phase 0 — no hardware needed

- [x] Finalize D1 schema incl. new tables (trees, soil_readings,
      conditions_readings, daily_readings, analyses, milestones, forecasts,
      forecast_alerts_config, journal_entries, chat_messages,
      species_reference, training_log, irrigation_zones, irrigation_events —
      all exist in `schema.sql`)
- [x] Build full frontend against mock/seeded data (5 real trees, redesigned
      UI: Grove/Trees/Environment/Timeline/Insights/Settings)
- [x] Stand up Worker skeleton, deploy to Cloudflare (`api.grove-iq.com` +
      `grove-iq.com` both live)
- [x] Seed the 5 tree profiles into D1 (species, thresholds, origin notes)
- [x] Write species reference entries (4 species covering the 5 trees —
      Alaska Yellow Cedar #1/#2 share one profile)

**Phase 0 is done.**

## Phase 1 — sensors arrive

- [x] Ecowitt account + API keys, gateway MAC confirmed
- [x] Verify real API payload shape against `ecowitt.ts` assumptions (found
      and fixed two real bugs: `pm25_ch1` vs `pm25_aqi`, rainfall unit ID)
- [x] Turn on cron polling, confirm data flowing into D1 (5-min cron live,
      `conditions_readings` populating)
- [ ] **WH52 soil sensors haven't arrived yet** — this is the blocker
- [ ] Map soil channels to trees, seed real thresholds from live data

Everything that doesn't depend on soil sensors specifically is done; per-tree
data (soil moisture/EC/temp, and therefore real tree status) is still demo
until the probes show up.

## Phase 2 — AI layer (core daily-use loop)

- [ ] Wire daily diagnostic + alerts — **not started**. No Anthropic API
      calls exist anywhere in the codebase yet; all "GroveIQ" insight text in
      the UI is deterministic logic (`analyzeTree` in mockData.ts) against
      demo data, not a real Haiku/Sonnet call.
- [ ] Add photo upload (manual) + vision analysis — not started
- [ ] Reolink E1 Outdoor Pro install + preset positions, wire scheduled
      capture into the vision pipeline — camera ordered, not installed; no
      capture/upload code exists

**Nothing in Phase 2 has started.** This is the biggest gap between "looks
like a real product" and "is one" — the whole AI layer is unbuilt.

## Phase 3 — depth

- [x] Smart Irrigation Module: Worker↔ESP32 API contract designed,
      documented (`docs/irrigation-api.md`), and implemented — tested
      end-to-end against live D1
- [x] ESP32 firmware scaffolded (PlatformIO) — **written but never flashed
      or run on real hardware**; pin assignments unconfirmed against the
      actual board
- [ ] Physical valve/drip install, local safety logic verified on real
      hardware — not done, needs the ESP32 physically wired up
- [ ] Comparative insights, dormancy mode — not started (depends on
      Phase 2's AI layer and real soil-sensor history)
- [ ] Forecast-based alerts (frost/wind/AQI) — not started; no NWS or
      AirNow integration exists (`forecasts` and `forecast_alerts_config`
      tables exist in schema but are unused)
- [ ] Milestones, journal entries, training log — schema exists, no UI to
      create/edit any of these (Timeline only *displays* milestones already
      seeded in mock data)

## Phase 4 — conversational + payoff

- [ ] AI chat (Sensei) — not started, no chat UI or `chat_messages` usage
- [ ] Voice input for journal entries — not started
- [ ] Pest/disease seasonal nudges, repotting reminders — not started
- [ ] Time Machine full experience — Timeline screen exists structurally
      (scrubber, event markers, synced metrics) but has no real photos and
      no real per-tree data yet; needs Phase 1 (soil sensors) + camera
- [ ] Annual retrospective — not started, needs a year of data regardless
- [ ] Smart Irrigation AI Mode — not started, needs irrigation_events
      history to exist first

## Cross-cutting / not phase-specific

- [x] Units toggle (US/Metric), applied consistently, persisted
- [x] EC values labeled with units everywhere
- [x] Device health (battery/freshness) surfaced in Settings from live data
- [x] Hover tooltips explaining every displayed metric
- [x] Live vs. demo data clearly labeled throughout the UI
- [ ] Email/SMS alert delivery (Resend/Twilio) — explicitly not wired up
      yet per Settings copy; tied to Phase 2's diagnostic+alert loop

## Open decisions carried from SPEC.md section 7 (still open)

- NWS forecast lat/long for the grove not yet confirmed/wired
- AirNow API key not signed up for (currently relying on Ecowitt's own
  PM2.5/AQI instead — reasonable substitute, but not what spec described)
- Dormancy thresholds are rough per-species guesses, not researched
- Self-tuning threshold auto-apply vs. always-ask: undecided (leaning
  always-ask per spec's own recommendation)
- Voice transcription approach undecided
- Irrigation AI Mode manual-confirm period: undecided
- Reolink mounting/preset count for covering all 5 trees: undecided
- Irrigation GHT↔FPT fitting compatibility: unconfirmed (needs hardware)
- Irrigation rotary switch requires soldering: unconfirmed comfort level

## Module #2 / #3 (Smart Rotation, AI Camera Station)

Concept-stage only per spec section 8.3 — explicitly deferred until Module #1
(irrigation) is fully built, tested, and stable. Not evaluated here.
